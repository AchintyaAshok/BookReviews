This folder consists of code that I used to retrieve ISBN, author & title information about books from Amazon's Web Services. Here, I employ an OOP approach to facilitate getting information from Amazon, allowing the caller to choose what kind of data they want (they are not restricted to book reviews). The AmazonSearch Class can be used to get just about anything from Amazon as long as you provide valid credentials and search parameters.
